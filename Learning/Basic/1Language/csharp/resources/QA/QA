Why there is a static main method in c#

Answer -	
C# applications have an entry point called Main Method. It is the first method which gets invoked whenever an application started and it is present in every 
C# executable file. The application may be Console Application or Windows Application. 
The most common entry point of a C# program is static void Main() or static void Main(String []args).

Meaning of the Main Syntax:

static: It means Main Method can be called without an object.
public: It is access modifiers which means the compiler can execute this from anywhere.
void: The Main method doesn’t return anything.
Main(): It is the configured name of the Main method.
String []args: For accepting the zero-indexed command line arguments. args is 
the user-defined name. So you can change it by a valid identifer. [] must come before the args otherwise compiler will give errors.
